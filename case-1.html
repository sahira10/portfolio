          <h3>Plot Behind Blood Sweat and Tears</h3>
          <div>
          <p>
            The painting on the picture is called The Fall of the Rebel Angels and it shows the fight between the good and the bad angels (fallen angels), which brings us to the concept of Blood Sweat & Tears.We know that throughout the story, the situation of the boys is getting worse and worse and they’re forced to fight against those depressive/suicidal thoughts and the aggressions (Suga - fight). But soon they can’t endure it any longer and they feel the need to let out those negative things. So they start to do bad things, they start to sin. We don’t know exactly what they do but it is for sure that they commit sins. Though, that doesn’t apply to each member. There are innocent ones.So in Blood Sweat & Tears, the difference between wanting to sin and resisting against sinning is shown (=> a fight between good and bad angels).But the thing is, this entire mv takes place in a world in between life and death. (this is also mentioned in Demian). It’s a world where you have to decide. And this all happens after Jin fully realised that he is dead, which concluded into his dream world falling apart. So after realising, he’s in the world in between life and death where he has to decide between good and evil. The difference between Jin, V, Jungkook and Rap Monster, Jhope, Jimin, Suga is that one group comes from the realm of death, while the other one comes from the realm of life, and they meet in the world between those two realms. Of course, this all indirectly happens in their mind and in reality, they’re not together.In the middle, we again have the painting that shows the fight between good and bad angels (fallen angels). The name of that painting is The Fall of the Rebel Angels.On each side of it we see entrances, one being black and the other one being white. So you either choose to sin and go through the black entrance, or you choose to resist and go through the white entrance.And Jin is right in the middle, which makes it seem as if he can’t decide.So basically, the symbol of a swing is the exact opposite of “youth is never coming back” (= means that one will never be innocent and fully happy again, because they’re now a part of the dark (maybe even evil world).The fact that Suga is sitting on thin glass, shows us just how close he is to falling into the abyss/into darkness. Meaning: how close he is to fully giving in to the temptation of letting it all out by sinning. The cloud around him shows that he can’t think clearly. There is something blocking him from thinking rationally. That something being all the negative emotions.These are all the things that Rap Monster wants. For example, reassurance. He wants to be reassured that everyone is fine since he is the one who has to take care of all of them. (you’ll see more to that) This means that all of these colours are supposed to be temptations. Meaning that evil tempts them by making them believe that they could get what they want (the colours represent what they want) if they take the evil path. As seen, apples are a sign of temptation and sin (apples are also mentioned in Demian). And on each plate, we see an apple.The chalice:Here, the chalice, just like the apple, represents temptation. (I’ll show you later on). And each member has a chalice.All these things right in front of them are tempting them to sin.Here we see V pushing himself off the balcony and in the background another painting is shown. This painting is called “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus”. It shows the fallen Icarus, after flying too high.Okay, first thing you need to know is that V and Icarus are connected. They both give into the temptation (Icarus: flying higher even though he was told not to do so / V: losing control and killing his dad) and the both fall down.But the reason why V is smiling as he falls down is because he is evil and he basically doesn’t mind it anymore. He fought to be innocent again but it didn’t work, so he completely lets himself fall into darkness.Then he sees the statue with the black wings. And just like how everyone was tempted with something they want, Jin is also met with something he desires. Wings. (will be explained in Awake)He can have both the wings and the boys but he has to choose the wrong path for that. And in the end, he decides to give in, that’s why by kissing the statue, Jin chooses the evil path.V lost his wings after falling, just like Icarus. Both of them misused the power of their wings, which is why they lost them and because of this similarity, throughout the mv, we always see things that indicate Icarus’ story. (more to that in the J-ver)These colours show that they’re becoming evil since they’re coming out of their bodies. Just like with V when Jhope shot him.

          <p>so basically, The harder a temptation is to resist, the more you think about it and vacillate. That uncertainty is part of the process of growing. Blood Sweat & Tears is a song that shows how one thinks, chooses, and grows.</p>
